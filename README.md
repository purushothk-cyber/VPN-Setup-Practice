# CyberSecurity Internship â€“ Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy

## Objective:
To understand how VPNs help protect online privacy and secure internet communication through IP masking and encryption.

## ðŸ› Steps Followed:

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: VPN Installation
- Chose **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)** as the VPN client.
- Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN application on my system.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Account Setup
- Created a free ProtonVPN account from their official website.
- Logged in to the ProtonVPN app with my credentials.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Connecting to VPN
- Selected a **free server** located in **Netherlands (NL-FREE#227)**.
- Clicked "Connect" and waited for the successful connection confirmation.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Verify Connection
- Used the `ifconfig` command on Kali Linux terminal to verify IP address change.
- Original IP was masked, and new IP (e.g., `10.2.0.2`) was assigned.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Proof of Connection
- Took a screenshot (`vpn_screenshot.png`) showing that the VPN was connected.

## Report Summary:
The report (`task 8.pdf`) and text file (`task_8_report.txt`) explain:
- How VPNs work
- Setup process
- Benefits (e.g., encryption, IP hiding)
- Limitations (e.g., slower speed, no full anonymity)
