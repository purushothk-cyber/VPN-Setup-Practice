Cyber Security Internship – Task 8

Task Title: VPN Setup and Privacy Protection

Objective:
To understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) work, their encryption mechanisms, and how they help protect online privacy.

Tools Used:
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- Kali Linux Terminal (for ifconfig verification)

Steps Followed:
1. Signed up and installed ProtonVPN.
2. Logged in and connected to a free server (Netherlands – NL-FREE#227).
3. Verified VPN connection using `ifconfig` in terminal – new IP `10.2.0.2` confirmed.
4. Captured screenshot as proof of VPN connectivity.
5. Researched and noted down VPN benefits and limitations.

VPN Benefits:
- Hides original IP address
- Encrypts all traffic
- Protects data on public Wi-Fi
- Bypasses content restrictions

VPN Limitations:
- Slower network speeds
- Free versions may have fewer server options
- Cannot guarantee full anonymity
- May not prevent browser-based tracking

Screenshot:

Conclusion:
Gained hands-on experience in setting up a VPN and understanding how it ensures privacy and data protection during internet usage.
